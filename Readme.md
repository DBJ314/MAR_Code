# Multitasking MAR Bot
This is code written for the game [Much Assembly Required](https://muchassemblyrequired.com/).
It contains a custom multitasking engine that lets a bot do several things at once.
There are build scripts and files for 2 bots: MARBot, and MultitaskingDemo.
MARBot is meant to be useful for playing Much Assembly Required. The code is a ugly mess.
MultitaskingDemo uses all the multitasking features in a way that is hopefully easy to understand.
It is designed to show other people how to use the multitasking engine.
